Password Strength Analyzer
Description
The Password Strength Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and provide feedback for improvement. Weak passwords are a common vulnerability in cybersecurity, and this tool helps users create stronger passwords by analyzing length, complexity, and common patterns.

This project was developed as part of a security automation class, showcasing practical skills in Python programming and applying security best practices.

Features
Password Strength Evaluation: Categorizes passwords as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."
Feedback Mechanism: Offers actionable suggestions to improve password strength.
Common Pattern Detection: Flags passwords containing common phrases or patterns (e.g., "12345," "password").
Interactive Input: Allows users to input passwords and receive instant analysis.
